# Kubernetes API

</div>

The Kubernetes API is a RESTful API that allows you to interact with a Kubernetes cluster by making HTTP requests to specific endpoints. These endpoints represent resources in the cluster, such as nodes, pods, services, and deployments. You can use the API to perform a variety of operations on these resources, such as retrieving information about them, creating new resources, updating existing resources, and deleting resources.

The Kubernetes API is organized into a series of resource types, each of which has its own set of endpoints and operations. For example, the /api/v1/nodes endpoint allows you to perform operations on nodes in the cluster, such as retrieving a list of all nodes or getting information about a specific node. Similarly, the /api/v1/pods endpoint allows you to perform operations on pods, such as creating a new pod or deleting an existing one.

You can interact with the Kubernetes API in a number of ways. One common way is to use the kubectl command-line tool, which provides a set of subcommands for interacting with the API. For example, you can use the kubectl get command to retrieve a resource, the kubectl create command to create a new resource, the kubectl delete command to delete a resource, and the kubectl patch command to update a resource.

You can also interact with the Kubernetes API directly by making HTTP requests to the API endpoints. For example, to retrieve a list of pods in a namespace, you can make a GET request to the /api/v1/pods endpoint:

```s
curl -X GET https://<kubernetes-api-server>/api/v1/pods
```

The Kubernetes API supports a number of different HTTP methods, such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and PATCH, which correspond to different operations that you can perform on resources. For example, a GET request retrieves information about a resource, while a POST request creates a new resource.

The Kubernetes API documentation provides a comprehensive reference for all of the available resources, endpoints, and operations. You can find the documentation at the following URL:

Note that the API documentation is versioned, so be sure to select the version that matches the version of your Kubernetes cluster.
