# Owners and Dependents

</div>

the concept of "ownership" and "dependencies" refers to the relationships between different objects in the cluster, such as pods, deployments, and services.

An object can be considered the "owner" of another object if it creates or manages that object. For example, a Deployment object in Kubernetes is the owner of the ReplicaSet and Pod objects that it creates. This means that if the Deployment object is deleted, the ReplicaSet and Pod objects will also be deleted.

On the other hand, an object can be considered a "dependent" of another object if it relies on that object in some way. For example, a Pod might be a dependent of a Service if the Service is responsible for routing traffic to the Pod.

In Kubernetes, you can use the OwnerReference field to specify the ownership relationship between objects. This can be useful for tracking and managing the lifecycle of objects in the cluster.

example of using the OwnerReference field to specify an ownership relationship between objects in Kubernetes:

```yaml
# Deployment object that creates ReplicaSet and Pod objects
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: my-container
        image: nginx:latest

# ReplicaSet object created by the Deployment
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: ReplicaSet
metadata:
  name: my-replicaset
  # Specify the Deployment as the owner of the ReplicaSet
  ownerReferences:
  - apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: my-deployment
    uid: a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-1234-567890abcdef
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: my-container
        image: nginx:latest

# Pod object created by the ReplicaSet
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod-1
  # Specify the ReplicaSet as the owner of the Pod
  ownerReferences:
  - apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: ReplicaSet
    name: my-replicaset
    uid: a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-1234-567890abcdef
spec:
  containers:
  - name: my-container
    image: nginx:latest
```

In this example, the Deployment object creates a ReplicaSet and Pod objects. The ReplicaSet and Pod objects both specify the Deployment as their owner using the OwnerReference field. This means that if the Deployment object is deleted, both the ReplicaSet and Pod objects will also be deleted.

Actually this is what happens behind the scenes, when we use deployment to deploy an application
when you create a Deployment in Kubernetes, the Deployment creates and manages a ReplicaSet and Pod objects behind the scenes. The ReplicaSet is responsible for maintaining a specific number of replicas (i.e., copies) of the Pod running at any given time, and the Pod is the basic execution unit in Kubernetes, containing one or more containers.
