## Kubernetes-DNS

</div>

Kubernetes DNS is a built-in service that provides DNS resolution for Kubernetes pods. This means that each pod gets its own DNS name, and the DNS server automatically maps the name to the corresponding IP address of the pod. This allows pods to communicate with each other using DNS names, rather than having to hard-code IP addresses, which can change if a pod is rescheduled to a different node in the cluster.

### An example of how Kubernetes DNS works:

Suppose you have a Kubernetes cluster with two nodes, Node1 and Node2. Each node has two pods, PodA and PodB. The pods are running different services, and they need to communicate with each other using DNS names.

The Kubernetes DNS server automatically assigns a DNS name to each pod, based on the pod's name and the namespace it belongs to. 

For example, the DNS name for PodA on Node1 might be pod-a.default.svc.cluster.local, where "default" is the name of the namespace and "cluster.local" is the default domain name for the cluster.

When PodA wants to communicate with PodB, it can simply use the DNS name of the other pod (e.g. pod-b.default.svc.cluster.local) rather than having to look up its IP address manually. The DNS server will handle the translation and route the request to the correct pod. This makes it easier to manage and maintain your application, as you don't have to worry about IP addresses changing if a pod is rescheduled.

### There are several different networking solutions for Kubernetes, including:

- Flannel: Flannel is a popular networking solution for Kubernetes that provides a simple, scalable, and secure way to connect containers across multiple hosts. It uses a distributed, Layer 2 overlay network to connect containers and provide them with unique, routable IP addresses.

- Calico: Calico is a network policy engine that provides fine-grained network security and traffic management for Kubernetes clusters. It uses a scalable, distributed data plane and network policies to enforce security rules and control network traffic.

- Cilium: Cilium is a networking and security solution for Kubernetes that uses the Linux kernel's built-in security features to provide efficient, scalable, and secure networking for containers. It allows users to define and enforce network policies based on container identity, labels, and other metadata.

- Weave Net: Weave Net is a container networking solution that provides a simple, secure, and scalable way to connect containers across multiple hosts. It uses an encrypted, peer-to-peer network to connect containers and provide them with unique IP addresses.

- Contiv: Contiv is a container networking and network policy management solution for Kubernetes. It provides a pluggable architecture that allows users to choose from different networking plugins, such as VLAN, VXLAN, and SR-IOV, and provides a rich set of network policies to control network traffic.
