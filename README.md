## What is Kubernetes?

Kubernetes is an open-source platform "Orchestration engine" mainly used to manage
containerized applications, it is released by Google in 2014, and the project is donated 
to CNCF (Cloud-native computing foundation), primarily it serves micro-services applications,
and it is still the world's second-biggest project in open source after Linux.


## Why use Kubernetes?

An orchestration engine helps to watch and control containerized applications very closely, 
and it is also used to automate certain functions, let me give an example for a better 
understanding this broad topic, Let's say one of your application service's containers went down,
it's not such a big deal to manually restart the container, but what if a large number of containers
went down suddenly, wouldn't be easy this task will be automatically done, this is where Kubernetes comes, k8's will restart the containers, not only that it also provides many services such as logging,
load balancing, secret, scheduling, scaling, fault-tolerance, deployment.

### Brief 

Kubernetes architecture has the master node, which is also called as control plane nowadays, 
which controls the nodes.these nodes are nothing but physical servers or VMs, which are run 
inside a data center applications are run inside the node, these nodes are previously called 
minions, In that, we have a lot of components such as type of service, cluster, pod.
